## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

### Screenshot

![](./images/my-solution_mobile.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Going into this project, my main objective was to practice breaking down the provided project design and translating it into markup for the browser. All too often it's easy to simply jump in and start typing away, only to go back and fix later. For this project I intentionally slowed down and put in the time to think about the design and how to translate it to be displayed in the browser. In doing so I was able to keep a structured workflow and methodically work through problems.

As I chose to not use a CSS preprocessor for this project, I found styling the range input elements to be particularly challenging. While the browser extension pseudo classes are not recommended for production code, perhaps attempting to style the range inputs without will be attempted later.

One such problem revolved around styling of the input ranges, as a self imposed challenge was to use vanilla CSS and no frameworks. This can be done

An additional object for this project was to practice building responsive layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
